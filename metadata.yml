Title: Morgan Fingerprint Embedding
Description: An embedding model created using PyTorch Metric Learning. Creates 100
  dimensional embeddings from 2048 dimensional Morgan Count Fingerprints. Trained
  on Cosine Similarity using a ChEMBL reference library of 2 Million Compounds. Particularly
  useful in approximating the properties of high-dimensional and sparse count fingerprints
  to dense 100 dimensional embeddings for creating similarity search indices from
  large compound datasets. Ideally this should perform well not just for similarity
  search models but also prediction, classification etc.
